# Fandango-Indeed-is-trusted-Movie-Critic-Source
There has been a claim against Fandango that it always display higher movie ratings compared to its competitors and also the reviews given by users on Fandango's site. 

This graph given on website shows the trend of movie ratings given by Fandango:

This graph is lop-sided towards one side. But the trend I got after analyzing the data represents something else, it can be seen here:

The trend is not lop-sided and it goes from low to high and vice-versa.Also the average ratings of other movie critics like IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes,Metacritics when compared to Fandango are in parallel with each other. Fandango does not show the maximum ratings as claimed.

The normalized ratings for Fandango are highest in the following graph:
https://github.com/tarachandaniheena/Fandango-Indeed-is-trusted-Movie-Critic-Source/issues/2

But the analysis obtained after comparing the normalized points are uniform with each other and Fandango here also maintains the same level as compared to peers. Also, there is a claim that Fandango displays false ratings as what the user actually gives.

This can be shown here that the lines are overlapping and hence Fandango does not show suspicious ratings:

How the graph is deceptive?

1.In the first graph of comparasion of average ratings, the measure for other critics is Maximum whereas for Fandango it is Average.

2.In second graph of movie ratings trend, filter has been used to keep movies with lower rating and move out the ones with higher ratings.

3.In Normalization, the Y-axis scale has been reduced to the point till it shows Fandango in the same range.
